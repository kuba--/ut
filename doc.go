// Package ut implements "Yet Another Efficient Unification Algorithm" by Alin Suciu (https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0603080v1).
// The unification algorithm is at the core of the logic programming paradigm,
// the first unification algorithm being developed by Robinson. More efficient algorithms were developed later by Martelli and, Montanari.
// Here yet another efficient unification algorithm centered on a specific data structure, called the Unification Table.
